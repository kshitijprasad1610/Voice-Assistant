# Voice-Assistant
Version: 1.0.0

It works on limited inputs like:
  1. add task
  2. list task
  3. take a screenshot
  4. open browser
  5. open youtube
  6. how r u
  7. i am also fine
  8. exit

Further updates will get more inputs. I am trying to implement natural language processing but it will take time.
